I ofter notices after 3D prints finish, thin plastic threads (stringing) often appear between gaps or travel paths. This ruins surface quality and usually requires manual post-processing. So I plan to build a system to auto smooth the printing, by automatically blows  **precisely controlled hot air**  at specific positions, we can do this thing to get smooth print.

### Bom
[Here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14x0yJbEj5C0rEIQlVVuA8SjHctHjPKWwfSs_GVw-i9w/edit?gid=1260412662#gid=1260412662) is the BOM for this printer

### CAD
The CAD file for the printer is available on [autodesk](https://autode.sk/42gcF8B) and [oneshape](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/3349b807a03fe84f4fc0f3cb/w/b2111816dbf8ea3aa4b7eab1/e/ff7fe39f09c31c14beff4fb1?renderMode=0&uiState=67faccc9e9a02b4af7a81ac3)

    -   **Glass Enclosure**:
        -   As shown by your blue outline, the printer is enclosed in a  **glass case**  to:
        -   Maintain internal temperature.
        -   Prevent air disturbance.
        -   Contain hot air application safely.
    -   **Airflow System:**
        -   A series of  **airflow nozzles**  (shown in purple dots on the sides in your image) installed vertically on both sides of the printer frame.
        -   These nozzles are controlled to release  **hot air**  in short bursts on specific layers or coordinates post-print.


Now its time to **build** *it*.
